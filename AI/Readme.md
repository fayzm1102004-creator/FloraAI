# FloraAI - Machine Learning Models

This directory contains the machine learning models and training notebooks responsible for diagnosing plant diseases from leaf images. 

## Supported Pathogens

The models are trained to classify images into the following categories[cite: 1]:
* Bacteria[cite: 1]
* Fungi[cite: 1]
* Healthy[cite: 1]
* Pests[cite: 1]
* Virus[cite: 1]

## Model Architectures

We experimented with and generated models using three different architectures to balance accuracy and performance[cite: 1]:
* **EfficientNetB0**[cite: 1]
* **MobileNetV2**[cite: 1]
* **ResNet50**[cite: 1]

## Directory Structure

* `EfficientNetB0/`: Contains the `.ipynb` training notebook, `.keras` model, and the quantized `.tflite` model for on-device inference[cite: 1].
* `MobileNetV2/`: Contains the `.ipynb` training notebook, `.keras` model, and the quantized `.tflite` model[cite: 1].
* `ResNet50/`: Contains the Jupyter notebook used for training the ResNet50 variant[cite: 1].

## Usage

The mobile application utilizes the `.tflite` files for lightweight, on-device predictions[cite: 1]. If you wish to retrain the models:

1. Install the required Python packages (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy).
2. Ensure you have the plant disease dataset downloaded locally

3. Run the respective `.ipynb` notebooks in Jupyter or Google Colab[cite: 1].
